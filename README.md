A little about me. 

For those interested, I've compiled a few pieces of what makes me me. 

## what I work on 

I do tech. Specifically, anything involving software development/IT management. 
Right now my day usually involves Kubernetes, React, Go, Linux, and most importantly, people.

I've also spent my fair share of time inside Windows server, Exchange, 365, and other...different...pieces
of the Microsoft stack.

I started out managing infrastructure for an MSP in a small town. We had companies that had 30 physical servers, 
200 workstations, and some with 3 workstations, and a few school districts thrown in as well. 

Quickly moved into a developer style role that combines the management aspect as well. Call me whatever buzz 
word you like, but my job was to design and build multiple pieces of software that all talked to each other. 
Microservices if you will. As a small team, we relied heavily on automation to make sure our productivity
wasn't stymied. gRPC, Kubernetes, Go, React, Ambassador, Postgres, and a couple other buzzwords are all 
apart of my arsenal that get used every day. Automation is key when dealing with all of these at once
as a small shop. Rumors fly that productivity is slowed down with Microservices at such a small scale,
but I disagree. If you can minimize your context switch cost and maximize your time but automating as much
of your workflow as possible, you can maintain productivity while maintaining the desired architecture. 
A lot of times it's not just following the buzzwords, but instead following the design decisions made by 
the stakeholders.

## how I work

I use a plethora of different tools throughout the day. Below are some things I use regularly, and 
how I use them.

### Project Management

I've used all of the major project management systems. I don't mind any of them, but I find 
a shared trello style kanban board to be effective enough for my questions. Where are we, what
are we working on, where are we going, and are we meeting expectations. 


### VIM

Check out my (dotfiles repo.)[https://github.com/teevans/cfg] for specific examples, but I've more or 
less turned VIM into my IDE of choice. Every now and again I'll try to switch back to something with 
more "language specific" features like Goland VS Code. Though great editors, they don't really fit 
my workflow speed. Typically when I switch back it goes like this: "VS Code has this feature built in. I'll
give it another shot. OK...I quit...can't do without VIM."

#### Iteration Cycle Speed

Get this metric up. Setup whatever you're working on to allow you to iterate over what you're changing fast.
That could mean a hundred things. If you're rolling a monolithic monstrosity from the 90's written in C++,
create another project for the module you're working on, setup a file watcher, write your tests, and 
go to town. Obviously you can't do that for everything, but it's worth spending 30 minutes setting up a 
great environment and tool set if it means you can make faster changes. 

#### FZF

This. Use this. For all the things. It's fast, it's great. I use it in vim for searching for files 
in the repo. I'll pipe ripgrep to it to fuzzy search strings, and I've got a bookmarks file in my 
home dir that I can put folder paths into. Then I'll alias something like 'bm' in my terminal to pipe
that file into fzf so I can quickly navigate folders. It's great. Use it.

#### <leader>gf
This goes to the file path listed under the cursor. Mind freaking blown. 

### i3 WM

I use i3-Gaps and Polybar. They're great. Being able to quickly launch a terminal with two keys, have it 
auto-tile the windows make running a quick command a freaking breeze.

### Rofi

This to launch apps. Admittedly I use like 4 apps. Chrome, terminator, yubiauth, and bloomRPC? Yeah.
Pretty sure that's it. But this tool is indispensable.
